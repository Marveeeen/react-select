## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React, Typescript

- I used vite to create my project folder then clean up for folder structuring.
- I created a Select component then hardcoded everything and set up mock data for styling.
- I styled the select component using module.css.
- Once done styling I add the functionality for single select only.
- Organize my file and refactor some code for cleanup and easy to maintain.

## Optimizations
- I also added another props that will determine if we want single select or multiple for flexibility.
- I added functionality for some keypress like (Enter, Space, Escape, Arrow Up and Arrow Done).
- Organize my file and refactor some code for cleanup and easy to maintain.

## Lessons Learned:

- Implementation of typescript in react.
- Implementaion of some function to make code DRY.
- Using module.css
- Adding and removing listener by using useRef.
